## Description.

<font size = ”1”> A set of mini-games launched from the console.
The set contains the following games:
- Brain-even
  
  The essence of the game is as follows: a random number is shown to the user. And he needs to answer "yes" if the number is even, or "no" if it is odd.
  #### [*Demonstration of the Brain-even game*](https://asciinema.org/a/547043)

- Brain-calc
  
  The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 35 + 16, which needs to be calculated and written down the correct answer.

- Brain-gcd
  
  The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown two random numbers, for example, 25 50. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

- Brain-prime
  
  The essence of the game is as follows: the player is shown a number. The player must determine whether the number is prime and answer "yes" or "no".
  #### [*Demonstration of the Brain-prime game*](https://asciinema.org/a/548446)
  
- Brain-progression
  
  The essence of the game is as follows: the player is shown a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number.
  #### [*Demonstration of the Brain-progression game*](https://asciinema.org/a/548355)
  
Games are run on the command line by calling commands: **brain-even, brain-calc, brain-gcd, brain-prime, brain-progression**.
